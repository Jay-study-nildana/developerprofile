## Welcome to my Developer Profile

Hello, I am Jay. I am a software developer and trainer. 

Previously, I maintained a website on wordpress, but I decided to use wordpress only for personal website. Almost all of my example code, open source projects are live on github, it made sense to simply set this right here on github. 

If you are a potential client, please consider this as my online resume/profile showcase.

## Open Source Projects

I maintain multiple open source projects, and many of them are used to show to clients, and also used when I take up corporate and college trainings.

1. ASP .NET based API server with bearer token authentication. [Github repo details here](https://github.com/Jay-study-nildana/ProjectWTPublicRepos/tree/master/ProjectCRUD)

## multi platform developer

I tend to work on multiple projects, on multiple platforms and across so many different technologies. I ended up working a lot in small teams for small businesses from all over the world (remotely), and I ended up picking so many different things. Hence, the many different projects listed above.
