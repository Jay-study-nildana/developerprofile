Note : Till 2021, I juggled between development and tutoring/training projects. As of 2021, due to personal reasons, I have retired from being a developer and have decided to focus on training only, going forward. As of 2022, I have now completely pivoted to coding tutor only. Looks like my days as a developer-for-hire are behind me.
