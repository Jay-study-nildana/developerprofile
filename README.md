## Welcome to my Developer Profile

Hello, I am Jay. I am a full time freelance, independent software developer and trainer. 

I am primarily a Backend REST API developer on .NET Platform with Deployment skills related to Azure Cloud and Azure DevOps. This is where I have mostly focused on, in the last 8 years. 

Of course, it is impossible to focus on one speciality in the current developer situation. To complement these backend development skills, I am familar with developing web apps using JavaScript and React. I am also familiar with mobile app development using React Native, Native Android and Native iOS. I have also dabbled in Node.JS BackEnd API development. 

If you are a potential client, please consider this as my online resume/profile showcase.
